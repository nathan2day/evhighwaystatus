## About
The site [evhighwaystatus.co.uk](https://evhighwaystatus.co.uk) was created by Andrew Lees in 2015 to provide functionality that was sought when entering the EV world for the first time after purchasing a Nissan Leaf. The site aims to provide users with a simple, clear, easy to understand interface to all things related to travelling with an EV.

> **Note** The site was developed over many months and was the result of a part-time hobby which was the catalyst for the learning of web development technologies from a knowledge base of zero. It therefore goes without saying that the coding philosophies and principles used throughout are likely sketchy at best. Over time this will be updated, but contributions are very much encouraged!

A number of features that the site currently provides to the EV community currently include:
- Full-screen map showing pins representing chargers from (at present) 10 UK charge point providers.
- Where available, the current status of the charge point.
- Route planner supporting up to 7 waypoints.
- Capability to take elevation variations in to account for routes.
- Energy prediction driven charge stop suggestions, including % battery arrival and departure at stops.
- Display, and tracking, of current location via GPS.
- Fully smartphone optimised.

## Code

The majority of the site's functionality in written in JavaScript and can be found in the public/js/script.orig.js file.

## Contributing

As professional commitments have grown, and free time reduced, this site has been released as open-source software. This has been done to help reduce the burden of development and to ensure the site continues to be a continually updated resource for EV drivers, and one which allows other community members to contribute to making it even better.
